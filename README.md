I am currently delving deeper into the field of technology through the course in Systems Analysis and Development. In the realm of programming, my focus is on frontend, blending my passion for arts and technology. I am also interested in Brazilian Sign Language (Libras), aiming to integrate communication and innovation. Always in pursuit of both professional and personal growth.
